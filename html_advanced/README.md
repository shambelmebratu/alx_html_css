For this first project, I will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

step 1: Create the HTML skeleton (html, head, body, etc.)

step 2: the banner Under the header, add a main element with inside a section element

step 3: Under the banner, I added the quote block: The quote section is inside the main

step 4: add the videos list in New section

step 5: Membership section is similar as the videos list by add a new section

step 6: The FAQ section is ending the page before the footer, Add a section for the FAQ

step 7: After the last section, outside of the main, add a footer
